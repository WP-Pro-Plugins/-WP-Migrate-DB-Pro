# WP Migrate DB Pro

WP Migrate DB is a WordPress migration plugin that makes exporting and migrating your database easy, fast, and straightforward.

Each migration takes shape in the form of an easy to follow three-step process.

Find and replace the data you want directly within the WP Migrate DB interface.
Export the SQL.
Import into your new database using a tool such as phpMyAdmin
Simple, right? We believe that WordPress database migration doesn’t have to be overly technical or opaque. Instead, WP Migrate DB was created with the sole aim of making WordPress site migration easy.

WP Migrate DB fully supports serialized data and arrays and can find and replace content within serialized arrays. What does this mean for you? It means it’s far easier to migrate your database, and there’s no risk of data corruption.

WP Migrate DB handles serialized data by unserializing the data and going through it, identifying strings and running a find & replace on them. Once it has gone through all the data, it serializes it again and sticks it back in the database.

Example: s:5:"hello" becomes s:11:"hello world"

You’re also able to run in-place find and replace, which lets you find and replace on the current database (without migration).
